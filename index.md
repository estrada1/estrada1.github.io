I am a Research Scientist at [The AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com) in Cambridge, Massachussetts. I am a roboticist passionate about systems leveraging contact with their environment.

I've been a robotics software developer spanning the control and planning stack at startups for [manufacturing](https://www.relativityspace.com/) and [warehouse](https://agilityrobotics.com/) floors. I'm a reformed academic; I completed my PhD with the [Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Lab](http://bdml.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University and lived several years in  Lausanne, Switzerland working as a researcher at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) with the [BioRobotics Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biorob/).
