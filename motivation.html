<h1>Motivation</h1>
</div>
<p>I am passionate about designing, prototyping and validating robotic hardware for applications where the mechanics of the system are critical to functionality. Most of my projects integrate a mixture of mechanical design, electronics, software and analysis of system dynamics to achieve this. </p>
<p>As a mechanical engineer, I'm rooted in the applied. That being said, my most recent position has allowed me to brush up on open-source software packages that have been pushing robotics forward. In addition to the delight of seeing prototypes move for the first time, I deeply enjoy the process of creating context around the engineering problems I am immersed in. Recently I have become hell-bent on documentation; I think usability, reproducibility, and portability of research are often significant barriers to progressing robotics, or any field, together. </p>
<p>Early inspiration to go into engineering includes vague memories of bio-inspired robots on television during high school, videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFXj81mvInc">Raibert's first hopping robots</a> from the late &rsquo;80s, undergraduate research with the <a href="http://biomimetics.mit.edu/">Biomimetic Robotics Lab at MIT</a>, and a broad interest as to why biological systems often beat out robots when it comes to interacting with their environment (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223609.Cats_Paws_and_Catapults">my favorite read on this</a>).</p>
